			<h3>Objects</h3>
			
			<p>The following types of objects will be used in the game:</p>
			
			<section id="object-connect-four">
				<h4>ConnectFour</h4>
				<p>An object to facilitate communication between each component of the game. A ConnectFour object has the following properties:</p>
				
				<ul class="properties">
					<li><b>turn</b>: a value from the Players enumeration, indicating whose turn it is.</li>
					<li><b>cells</b>: a GRID_WIDTH x GRID_HEIGHT matrix that represents the cells in the grid.</li>
				</ul>

			<section id="object-cell">
				<h4>Cell</h4>
				<p>An object representing a cell in the grid. A Cell object has the following properties:</p>
				
				<ul class="properties">
					<li><b>player</b>: a value from the Players enumeration, indicating if a player has placed their piece in the cell.</li>
				</ul>

		<h2>Functions/Methods</h2>
		
		<p>
			<b>createGame()</b><br/>
			Returns a randomly generated code that can be used by another client to begin a multiplayer game. Connects to the socket and waits for opponent.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<b>joinGame(code)</b><br/>
			Joins a game identified by a randomly generated code. Connects to the socket channel and notifies the opponent of arrival.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<b>restartGame()</b><br/>
			Sets the player of each cell to NONE, and sets the current turn to BLACK. If playing a networked game, sends a message to the opponent telling them the game has been restarted.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<b>makeMove(player, cell)</b><br/>
			Sets the player of the cell to the given player. If playing a networked game, sends a message to the opponent telling them the move has been made.

		<h2>Notes</h2>

		<p>
			-- To eliminate the need for a dedicated server, a WebSocket relay server is used for communication between networked games. To support concurrent games, a random code will be generated for each session, and used as the channel for the WebSocket. Different URL's for the socket can be found at <a href="http://sockets.mbed.org/me.ryanp.connect-four.code">http://sockets.mbed.org/me.ryanp.connect-four.code</a>, where code is replaced with the code of the game session.

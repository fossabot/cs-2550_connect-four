				<h2>Functions/Methods</h2>

				<section class="block">
					<h3>createGame()</h3>
					<p>Returns a randomly generated code that can be used by another client to begin a multiplayer game. Connects to the socket and waits for opponent.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="block">
					<h3>joinGame(code)</h3>
					<p>Joins a game identified by a randomly generated code. Connects to the socket channel and notifies the opponent of arrival.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="block">
					<h3>restartGame()</h3>
					<p>Sets the player of each cell to NONE, and sets the current turn to BLACK. If playing a networked game, sends a message to the opponent telling them the game has been restarted.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="block">
					<h3>makeMove(player, cell)</h3>
					<p>Sets the player of the cell to the given player. If playing a networked game, sends a message to the opponent telling them the move has been made.</p>

						To eliminate the need for a dedicated server, a WebSocket relay server is used for communication between networked games. To support concurrent games, a random code will be generated for each session, and used as the channel for the WebSocket. Different URL's for the socket can be found at <a href="http://sockets.mbed.org/me.ryanp.connect-four.code">http://sockets.mbed.org/me.ryanp.connect-four.code</a>, where code is replaced with the code of the game session.
